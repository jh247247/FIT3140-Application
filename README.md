FIT3140-Application
===================

Android application to halftone an image somehow.

Since I don't use eclipse for this application (Thomas did, but he
wasn't able to upload this due to being uncontactable.), I (Jack) will
give you some handy instructions on how to make the application (or
how I did it anyway)

Assuming that the android SDK is in your $PATH, all you need to do is
to run "make" in the same directory as the readme.

This cleans the prolect and compiles it from scratch.

The APK should be in the "bin" dir and be called "nowlayout-debug.apk"
I've pre-built it for you if you don't have the time (or run into
complications) So all you need to do is install the apk onto one of
the nexus 7s and things should work swimmingly.

Thanks,
Jack and Thomas
