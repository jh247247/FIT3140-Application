Product Overview:
Old Newspaper App is an application for android that allows you to load images
from your device, apply a newspaper-style halftone filter to them and then
share them elsewhere.

Creators:
Jack Hosemans and Thomas Parasiuk

Currently Implemented:
Image loading from gallery, camera, share intent from other apps.
Applying halftone filter to image.
Applying caption to image.
Saving image on device.
Sharing image to other apps.

Getting Started:
Load in an image by tapping the gallery or camera button at the top of the
screen. You can also share an image from another app.

Swipe across the bottom half of the screen to see the currently implemented
filters you can apply to the image. Press the "Apply" button to apply them.

Once the image has been edited to your liking, press the share or save
buttons to share or save it.

Known Bugs/Limitations:
Halftone filter could perhaps be further optimised.
It may take a little bit of time to process larger images, especially with small grid sizes.

On devices with very small resolutions (Mostly a problem for emulators) some of
the application can be cut off the bottom of the screen.
